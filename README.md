This repo contains all the assignments I completed in my programming 3 (COMP 2503) class.

Assignments 1, 2, 5, and 6 is a word frequency counter program that makes use of various data structures that I created (array list, linked list, binary search tree, and abstract data types from the Java Collections framework).

Assignment 3 are three mini programs that makes use of stacks and queues.

Assignment 4 is a program that determines the number of white areas and the number of cells that make up each area using recursion.

More information about each assignment can be found in the PDF files located within each assignment directory.
